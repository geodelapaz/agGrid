# ag-Grid

A sample ag-Grid implementation.

This tutorial works on both enterprise and free version.

Please be mindful that when using the ag-Grid enterprise version, you need to purchase a license in order to run your code live. 
Otherwise, ag-Grid loads a watermark on your work and prints an error message on the console.
